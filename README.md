# shogt
Play GHOST, but with anagrams!

## To Play:
Unzip from here: https://github.com/isaac-ped/shogt/archive/master.zip

Double click on `play_shogt`
-- or --
Open terminal, type:
```
python path/to/shogt/shogt.py
```


### Rules

* On your turn, add on a letter to the anagram
* If the last letter of the anagram is the last letter of the word it's an anagram of, you lose!
* You MUST have a word in mind that can still be completed
   * If the last letter of the word has already been said, that is no longer a valid word
       * (e.g. if GHOST was the only word in the english language, and the letters SGH have said played, you could not say "T", and would instead have to say "O")
